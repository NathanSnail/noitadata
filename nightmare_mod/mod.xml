<!-- 
	If a mod requires access to the full lua api e.g. os.* io.* it has to request acesss via 'request_no_api_restrictions="1"'.
	It is recommended that other options are explored first, as we may completely disable those APIs in the future.
	By default mods have access to the table, string, math and bit libraries and to the APIs exposed by the game.
 -->

<!--
	if 'is_game_mode="1"', the mod will be display in the new game menu as a game mode and activates when playing that game mode.
	ui_newgame_* control how the mod is displayed in the game mode menu.
